    <p>My Journey into Tech

        I once sent over 150 applications to universities and institutions across the world hoping, waiting, praying. Most went unanswered. Some said no. But deep inside, I refused to quit. I held onto the dream that had burned in me for years.
        
        It wasn’t easy there were days I doubted, nights I cried, moments I felt stuck. But I kept going. And by God’s grace, a door finally opened. That door was PLP Academy and with it came clarity, direction, and the courage to start building the future I had always seen in my heart.
        
        If you're reading this and feel like giving up, don’t. Delay is not denial. Every "no" brings you closer to your "yes." Your dream is valid. Keep pressing on grace will carry you where effort alone can't.</p>
